# Mastering AI Quote Generation

Quotla's AI assistant is designed to understand natural language and create professional quotes instantly. Here are some tips to get the best results.

## Basic Quote Creation

The simplest way to create a quote is to describe it conversationally:

**Example 1: Simple Product Quote**
```
Create a quote for Smith Construction for 50 units of premium cement at $120 each
```

**Example 2: Service Quote**
```
Quote for Johnson Marketing: Website redesign project, $5,500, due in 30 days
```

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Include Complete Business Information

For best results, provide all relevant details in your conversation:

```
I need a quote for my client Acme Corp located in New York.
They want 100 custom widgets at $45 per unit,
plus installation service for $500.
Apply 8% sales tax and set payment terms to Net 30.
```

The AI will extract:
- Client name: Acme Corp
- Location: New York
- Line items with quantities and prices
- Tax rate
- Payment terms

### 2. Use Natural Numbers

The AI understands various number formats:

- **"5k"** = $5,000
- **"2.5k"** = $2,500
- **"15 hundred"** = $1,500
- **"fifty"** = 50

### 3. Build Quotes Conversationally

You don't need to provide all information at once. Have a conversation:

**You:** "Create a quote for ABC Company"

**AI:** "I'll help you create a quote for ABC Company. What items or services would you like to include?"

**You:** "25 units of Product A at 200 each"

**AI:** "Got it. Should I add anything else?"

**You:** "Add delivery fee of 150 and create the quote"

### 4. Specify Currency and Units

Make currencies and units explicit when needed:

```
Quote for European client:
€1,500 for consulting services,
payment in euros
```

### 5. Include Special Terms

Add custom notes and terms:

```
Create quote for renovation project, $12,000 total.
Note: Requires 50% deposit upfront.
Materials included. Timeline: 6 weeks.
```

## Common Patterns

### Product Sales
```
Quote for [Client Name]:
[Quantity] units of [Product] at $[Price] each
```

### Services
```
Quote for [Client Name]:
[Service Description], $[Total Amount],
delivery by [Date]
```

### Mixed Items
```
Quote for [Client Name]:
- [Product A]: [Qty] at $[Price]
- [Product B]: [Qty] at $[Price]
- [Service]: $[Amount]
Add [X]% tax
```

## Editing After Creation

After the AI creates your quote, you can:

1. **View** the generated quote immediately
2. **Edit** any details manually
3. **Customize** the design and branding
4. **Send** directly to your client

## Pro Tips

### Save Time with Client Profiles

Once you create a quote for a client, Quotla remembers them. Next time, just say:

```
Create another quote for ABC Company for different items
```

The AI will use the saved client information.

### Use Templates for Recurring Quotes

For quotes you send regularly:

1. Create the first one with AI
2. Save it as a template
3. Reference it: "Create a quote like the one for ABC Company last week"

### Batch Creation

Create multiple quotes in one session:

```
I need quotes for three clients:
1. ABC Corp - 50 units at $100
2. XYZ Ltd - 30 units at $150
3. DEF Inc - 75 units at $80
```

## Troubleshooting

### AI Didn't Understand?

If the AI misunderstands, simply clarify:

**You:** "That's not quite right. The price should be $500 per unit, not total"

**AI:** "I'll update that. Let me create a new quote with $500 per unit..."

### Missing Information?

The AI will ask for required details:

**AI:** "I need a bit more information. What's the client's name?"

**You:** "ABC Company"

### Need to Start Over?

Just say:
```
Let's start over with a new quote
```

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Include quantities, prices, and client names
2. **Use Natural Language**: Write as you would speak
3. **Review Before Sending**: Always check the generated quote
4. **Provide Context**: Mention special terms or requirements
5. **Save Templates**: Reuse successful quote formats
