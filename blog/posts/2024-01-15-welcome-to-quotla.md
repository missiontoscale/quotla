# Welcome to Quotla

We're excited to introduce Quotla, the intelligent quote and invoice management platform designed specifically for small businesses and freelancers.

## The Problem We're Solving

Creating professional quotes and invoices has traditionally been time-consuming and tedious. Business owners spend hours:

- Formatting documents
- Calculating totals and taxes
- Managing client information
- Tracking quote status
- Following up on approvals

## Our Solution: AI-Powered Document Creation

Quotla leverages artificial intelligence to streamline the entire process. Here's what makes us different:

### 1. Create Documents in 2 Minutes or Less

Simply tell our AI assistant what you need, and watch as it generates a professional quote or invoice instantly. No more wrestling with templates or spreadsheets.

### 2. Natural Language Processing

Describe your quote in plain English:

> "Create a quote for ABC Company for 25 units of 200G product at $5,000 each"

Quotla understands your intent and creates a perfectly formatted document.

### 3. Intelligent Client Management

The system remembers your clients and automatically fills in their information for future quotes.

Every document is beautifully formatted and ready to send. Customize your branding, add your logo, and choose from multiple template styles.
