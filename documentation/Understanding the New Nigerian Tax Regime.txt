Introduction
Nigeria’s tax framework has changed. On 26 June 2025, President Bola Ahmed Tinubu signed into
law, four significant tax legislations – the Nigeria Tax Act, 2025, the Nigeria Tax Administration Act,
2025 the Joint Revenue Board of Nigeria (Establishment) Act, 2025 and the Nigeria Revenue Service
(Establishment) Act, 2025 (the “Tax Laws”). Together, these enactments introduce far-reaching
changes aimed at streamlining tax administration, enhancing compliance, and reforming the
Nigerian tax regime. The new regime is expected to take effect from 1 January 2026.

Selected Key Changes
The Nigeria Tax Act (the NTA)

Consolidation of Tax Legislations: Before the enactment of the NTA, various taxes were
governed by separate, distinct legislations. The NTA now consolidates the statutory framework
for taxing corporate and individual incomes, chargeable gains, transactions, and instruments

into a single legislation. This unification offers a comprehensive view of tax laws and eliminates
overlaps and inconsistencies across separate statutes.
➢

Unified Taxation on All Sources of Income: Under the NTA, the taxable profits of companies and
individuals now comprise the total assessable profits from all sources, including chargeable
gains. By implication, a company’s total profits now include chargeable gains, which are taxed
at 30%. For individuals, capital gains are assessed at their applicable personal income tax rates.
Previously, income and capital gains were taxed under separate laws and at differing rates —
30% under Companies Income Tax Act (“CITA”) for companies and 10% under the Capital
Gains Tax Act (“CGTA”) for capital gains.

➢

Imposition of an Effective Tax Rate (ETR): The NTA imposes an effective tax rate (“ETR”) of 15%
on any company that: (i) forms part of a Multinational Enterprise (“MNE”) group, and (ii) meets
the prescribed financial threshold in the relevant year of assessment. This ETR applies in any year
where the company’s ETR falls below 15%.2
The Federal Inland Revenue Service (“FIRS”) is mandated to issue regulations specifying the
companies to which this provision applies and to provide guidance on how the tax payable
will be determined.

➢

Introduction of Controlled Foreign Company Regime: The NTA curbs profit shifting by Nigerian
multinationals through a new Controlled Foreign Company (“CFC”) regime. Nigerian
companies with controlling interests in foreign subsidiaries may now be taxed on the
subsidiaries’ undistributed profits, unless they can prove that distributing such profits would be
detrimental to the CFC.

➢ Flat Tax Rate for Companies [Excluding Small Companies]: The NTA simplifies the corporate tax
structure by replacing the previous tiered tax rates with a flat 30% corporate tax rate for all
companies, except small businesses (with turnover below the prescribed threshold), which
remain exempt at 0%.
➢ Taxation of Non-Resident Entities: The NTA introduces two key measures for taxing non-resident
entities earning income in Nigeria: the Global Profit Margin Rule and the Minimum Tax Threshold
Rule.
Under the Global Profit Margin Rule, where a non-resident’s actual profits from Nigerian
operations (e.g., through a permanent establishment or significant economic presence)
cannot be determined, the tax authority may apply the non-resident’s global profit margin to
its Nigerian revenue to calculate taxable profits.
The Minimum Tax Threshold Rule ensures that the tax payable by a non-resident is not less than
the amount withheld at source. Where withholding tax is not applicable, a minimum tax of 4%
on total Nigerian-derived income will be imposed.

2 Section 57 of the Bill. The NTA defines effective tax rate to mean the rate produced by dividing the aggregate covered tax paid by

a company for a year of assessment by the profits of the company. Thus, where upon this calculation, the rate produced is less than
15%, a company will be required to pay additional taxes to bring the effective tax rate to the 15% threshold.

➢

Economic Development Tax Incentive: The NTA replaces the pioneer status incentive with the
Economic Development Tax Incentive (“EDTI”) Scheme, offering a five-year tax credit and
additional credit on qualifying capital expenditure for companies in designated priority sectors.
To qualify, companies must have their capital expenditure verified by the Industrial
Inspectorate Department. Extensions are only allowed if profits earned during the incentive
period are reinvested in expanding the same products. Unutilised tax credits can be carried
forward for five years, after which they will lapse.

➢

Introduction of a Development Levy on Companies: The NTA introduces a 4% development levy
on the assessable profits of all companies, other than profits of small companies, non-resident
companies, and profits assessed for hydrocarbon tax purposes. The levy replaces the erstwhile
1% NITDA levy, 0.25% NASENI levy, 0.005% Police Trust Fund levy, and the 3% Education Tax.

➢

Changes to Capital Allowance Framework: The NTA streamlines the capital allowance regime
by eliminating initial allowances and retaining annual allowances, thereby reducing the
claimable allowances in the first year of incurring the qualifying capital expenditure. It also
clarifies the administration of capital allowances by requiring immediate deduction of capital
allowance claims, allowing the carry-forward of unclaimed capital allowances, and pro-rating
capital allowances on assets which are not held for the full period of assessment.

➢

Amendment to Research and Development (R&D) Deductions: The NTA caps deductible R&D
expenses at 5% of a company’s turnover (previously 10% of total profits under the repealed
CITA and removes the 20% investment tax credit for R&D undertaken for commercial purposes).

➢

Taxation of Export Processing and Export Free Zone Entities: Under the NTA, tax exemption
applies only to profits from goods that are (i) exported outside Nigeria or (ii) used as inputs for
goods exclusively meant for export. Profits from non-qualifying supplies are taxable on a
proportional basis.

➢

Relief from Double Taxation: The NTA broadens Nigeria’s double taxation relief by allowing
Nigerian taxpayers to claim a foreign tax credit for taxes paid on income earned abroad, even
from countries without a tax treaty with Nigeria. This departs from the previous CITA regime,
which limited relief to Commonwealth countries and treaty partners.

➢

New Condition for Decommissioning and Abandonment Fund Deductions: The NTA restricts
petroleum companies, operating under the PIA, from claiming tax deductions for
decommissioning and abandonment fund contributions. To qualify, a specified portion of the
contribution must be deposited in a Nigerian bank escrow account accessible to the Nigerian
Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission (“NUPRC”) or the Nigerian Midstream and
Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (“NMDPRA”).

➢

Comprehensive Reform of Stamp Duties: The NTA overhauls Nigeria’s stamp duties framework,
introducing a clearer, structured regime with defined chargeable instruments, rates, and payer
obligations.

➢

Taxation of Digital Assets: Previously, the tax treatment of gains from digital asset disposals
lacked clarity. The NTA now expressly provides for the tax treatment of profits and gains from
digital asset transactions, removing ambiguity.

➢

Modification to Taxation of Share Disposal Proceeds: Gains from the disposal of shares, where
the disposal proceeds are less than ₦150 million and the chargeable gain does not exceed

www.templars-law.com

₦10 million in any 12 consecutive months are now exempt from tax. This raises the previous
threshold from ₦100 million and introduces an additional condition that the gains must not be
more than ₦10 million. The NTA also introduces an indirect share transfer taxation regime by
stipulating that CGT may apply on certain disposals of shares in intermediary holding
companies.
➢

Electronic Fiscal System for VAT Compliance: The NTA and Nigeria Tax Administration Act
introduces the use of a mandatory Electronic Fiscal System (“EFS”) for VAT administration. All
taxable persons making taxable supplies must now implement the EFS to record and report
transactions.

➢

Expanded VAT Exemptions and Zero-Rated Items: The NTA broadens the list of items exempted
from VAT and those classified as zero-rated. Under the new framework, certain goods previously
zero-rated are now exempt, while some exempt items have been reclassified as zero-rated.
Exempt items now include oil and gas exports, crude petroleum oil, feedgas for processed gas.
Zero-rated items now cover essential goods and services including basic food items, medical
and pharmaceutical products, educational books, fertilizers, medical services, exported
services, and exported goods (excluding oil and gas).

➢

Recovery of Input VAT on Services and Assets: The NTA now allows taxpayers to deduct input
VAT paid on services and fixed assets from their output VAT, provided that it is directly related
to their taxable supplies and it is claimed within five years from the end of the relevant tax
period. Where input VAT relates to both taxable and non-taxable supplies, only the portion
attributable to taxable supplies is deductible.
The Nigeria Tax Administration Act (NTAA)

➢

Advance Tax Rulings: The NTAA introduces a framework for advance tax rulings, enabling
taxpayers to seek formal guidance on the interpretation and application of tax laws to specific
transactions. Although these rulings are not binding on the Nigerian Revenue Service, they offer
valuable clarity and help reduce uncertainty in tax planning and compliance.
The Joint Revenue Board of Nigeria (Establishment) Act (the JRBA)

➢

Establishment of the Tax Ombud Office: The JRBA establishes the Office of the Tax Ombud to
address complaints against tax officials and authorities. Designed to enhance taxpayer
protection and promote accountability in tax administration, the Ombud focuses on resolving
administrative and procedural grievances. However, it cannot interpret tax laws or interfere
with matters under the jurisdiction of the Tax Appeal Tribunal. The Tax Ombud plays a key role
in resolving administrative and procedural tax-related grievances.
The Nigeria Revenue Service (Establishment) Act (the NRSA)

➢

The Nigeria Revenue Service (“NRS”) replaces the Federal Inland Revenue Service: The NRSA
dissolves the FIRS and establishes the Nigerian Revenue Service as its successor. The NRS is
vested with broader powers to collect and administer taxes, duties, levies and other revenues
for the federal government, positioning it as the central agency under Nigeria’s reformed tax
framework.
