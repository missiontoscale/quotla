A. When I ran the profitability-tracking-schema.sql in Supabase, I got the following error:
Error: Failed to run sql query: ERROR: 42703: column i.amount_paid does not exist LINE 48: i.amount_paid, ^
there is no amount paid column in the invoices table in the DB actually

B. 
The pricing on home page ought to have the same logic that allows for the currency to be the local currency. I believe there is a component for that.
Patch it up properly

C.
The pricing page ought to be same as the pricing section on the home page. 
It should have those prices, faqs, and on other call to action section

D.
Consolidate all ".md" files [except PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.txt] into a single PROGRESS.md, delete others
