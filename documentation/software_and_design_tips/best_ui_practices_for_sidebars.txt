Best UX Practices for Designing a Sidebar
Sidebars in user interfaces have always attracted my attention in terms of research and potential for improving user experience. They are one of the most popular components of any modern web application, helping the user navigate the application by organizing and presenting content and features in a structured and logical manner, implementing the principles of information architecture (IA).

While researching many sidebars in popular web applications and designing them in different digital projects, I began to notice recurring patterns and techniques used in their design that were well received by users and contributed to their engagement. The accumulated knowledge and results of my own research in this area inspired me to write this article, where I would like to share best practices in designing sidebars that improve usability.

Why sidebar design matters
Sidebars are undoubtedly one of the most important navigation tools for users, and our task as designers is to help users access key features quickly and conveniently while keeping the main workspace uncluttered. Given that the structure and information architecture of some applications can be quite extensive and complex, designing a sidebar is undoubtedly a challenge for any designer. However, having clear guidelines in the form of examples and practices that have already proven effective and created positive user experiences provides a solid foundation for designing functional sidebars.

Below I have highlighted important aspects of the importance of sidebars:

Efficiency: Logically structured sidebars make it much easier for users to navigate through the application, allowing them to perform targeted actions quickly and efficiently, reducing cognitive load.
Space Optimization: Sidebars take up to approximately 15% of the workspace when expanded and can be collapsed, allowing them to be used efficiently without cluttering the main workspace while still allowing access to features and sections. Users can minimize and maximize them as needed, using them as the primary navigation tool in the application.
Accessibility: Sidebars are customizable based on individual user preferences, making them universal in use, giving users a choice. Sidebars can change mode, size, customization in terms of structure and organization of information depending on user preferences.
Consistency: Sidebars offer a convenient and consistent way to organize information, making the interface clear and logical, ensuring a smooth user flow. Well-organized sidebars with a clear structure guarantee efficiency, quick learning and avoidance of possible errors for the user.
Adaptability and Flexibility: Sidebars provide a solid foundation for future product development by adding new features and sections. The sidebar can grow and improve with the product, providing convenience and functionality for users.
Clear prioritize user tasks: A well-designed sidebar minimizes distractions, allowing users to focus on their tasks while serving as an effective navigation tool.
By following the best practices outlined in this article, you’ll not only create a functional sidebar but also a design that resonates with your users.

#1 Optimal Sidebar Width
Keep the width functional: 240–300px for expanded mode, 48–64px for collapsed mode. It ensures clarity without taking up too much space.

Actionable Items:
✅ Set the width ranges within the recommended limits: 240–300px for expanded mode, 48–64px for collapsed mode.
✅ Add real content, using clear names for sections and functions, taking into account different lengths of menu item names, space between items, and icon size.
✅ Conduct user testing using the expanded and collapsed views of the sidebar and gather feedback for further improvements.
✅ Optimize the responsiveness of the sidebar for different screen resolutions, and determine the behavior of the sidebar on different devices, including mobile and tablet versions.
✅ Include visual cues in the form of tooltips that are displayed on hover for additional clarity, especially for the collapsed view of the sidebar, where menu items are often displayed as icons.

💡 Pro Tip: Test your sidebar width with real content and users to ensure readability and usability.

#2 Switch Navigation Dynamically for Context
Adapt the sidebar to display a focused settings menu when users navigate to specific sections like [Settings]. This keeps the interface streamlined and reduces distractions.

Actionable Items:
✅ Analyze the additional sections of the application to determine which ones need additional navigation. Typically, this is the settings section, which may include basic and other settings that require structured and organized navigation.
✅ Create a sidebar design for the selected section, showing the necessary items and subsections, providing logical transitions between the main sidebar and additional ones.
✅ Add a visual difference in the display of the dynamic panel that the user can distinguish where the main panel is and where the additional panel is.
✅ Test usability in different scenarios and determine how intuitive the dynamic sidebar is.

💡 Pro Tip: Always include a “Back to Main Menu” to allow users to easily return to the primary navigation.
