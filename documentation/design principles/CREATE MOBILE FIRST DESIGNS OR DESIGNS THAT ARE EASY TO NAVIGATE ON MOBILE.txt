Easiest way to make website responsive on all screens?
So I normally I have the site open on one screen and my code editor open on the other screen. For some reason I dragged my website onto the screen where my code editor is normally open and everything was out of whack. There for a second I thought I deleted something on accident and messed everything up, but then it clicked on me that the screens are different sizes. What’s is the simplest way to make sure my site looks good on all screens sizes?

Do I really have to make media queries for both screens? And then more for my laptop, tablet, phone?Is there a way to use percentages to make it easier?

Side not I was using rems for everything.

Any help is appreciated and hope everyone is having a good day!

Do I really have to make media queries for both screens? And then more for my laptop, tablet, phone?Is there a way to use percentages to make it easier

 

No, that's not how you're supposed to use media queries.

 

Media queries are used to set "layout break points" where you decide that your layout A should "change" and switch to layout B (to be more comfortable for the user). And if you need more layout options you can set another point to switch from B to C. Or even more, depending on your layout's complexity. Those break points are based on your specific layout. The device/screen size doesn't matter at all.

How do you set those break points? Well, each layout behaves in a different way so my suggestion is to simply look at the page while you resize the browser. Keep resizing until you feel it doesn't look good anymore: take note of the browser width (in pixels) and use it as your first break point to switch to an alternative layout.

Example: you have a 4-columns page filled with text. It looks great on a big screen but as soon as you resize the browser... Those columns get squished and the text wraps so much that you can't comfortably read it. Maybe 3 columns would be better for the user, because the text would look less crowded and easier to read, right? By simply looking at the screen while you resize the browser, you realize that when you're around the 1050-1000px range it feels bad and having 3 columns would make more sense. Choose a sweet spot (1050px would be fine and you have your first break point. Then you keep resizing and the 3 columns alternative falls apart when you're close to 800px. And that's your second break point, where you can switch to 2 columns. Or maybe you can switch to a single column already, which is the typical choice for mobile users.

Also, breakpoints don't have to be the same for the whole page. If your desktop menu looks weird at 800px, put a media query there. Don't refrain because the rest of your website so far only had them at 1000 and 700.

Absolutely. Do you need a break point for a specific element? Do it!

If you use flexbox you can set flex-wrap on parent and min-width on elements, but I recommend getting used to media queries 😎

sounds like you would benefit from some kind of responsive web design 101 course. media queries are the way, but you want to be strategic and thoughtful about how you structure them because it can easily get out of hand and turn into a mess if you don't follow some simple best practices.

Don't target specific devices or sizes!
The general wisdom is not to target specific devices or sizes, but to reframe the term 'breakpoint':

develop the site for mobile-first using percentages or ems, not pixels,

then try it in a larger viewport and note where it begins to fail,

redesign the layout and add a CSS media query just to handle the broken parts,

repeat the process until you reach the next breakpoint.

You can use responsivepx.com to find the 'natural' breakpoints, as in 'breakpoints are dead' by Marc Drummond.

Use natural breakpoints
The 'breakpoints' then become the actual point at which your mobile design begins to 'break' i.e. cease to be usable or visually pleasing. Once you have a good working mobile site, without media queries, you can stop being concerned about specific sizes and simply add media queries that handle successively larger viewports.

If you're not trying to pin design to exact screen size, this approach works by removing the need to target specific devices. The integrity of the design itself at each breakpoint ensures that it will hold up at any size. In other words, if a menu/content section/whatever stops being usable at a certain size, design a breakpoint for that size, not for a specific device size.

See Lyza Gardner's post on behavioral breakpoints, and also Zeldman's post about Ethan Marcotte and how responsive web design evolved from the initial idea.

Use semantic markup
Further, the simpler and more semantic the DOM structure with nav, header, main, section, footer etc. (avoiding abominations like div class="header" with nested inner div tags) the easier it will be to engineer responsiveness, especially avoiding floats by using CSS Grid Layout (Sarah Drasner's grid generator is a great tool for this) and flexbox for arranging and re-ordering according to your RWD design plan.

Just follow the methods done in this video series and it will explain everything

https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMPdeA59PPg2jD1y2GOrwuTNrGTZXLgCA

You should be developing mobile first. So on your browser with your project open, right click and inspect it and set the display size to 320px wide. Build your website starting with that screen size.

Then drag the screen bigger and bigger. Once you reach a point where the design breaks or looks stupid add a media query for that pixel size. Do this until you reach your final desktop size.

It’s important to know and understand flexbox and how to use it to arrange content. This will be the core of your work.

Then know how to use containers. I set mine to be width 96%, Margin auto to center it, max-width of however big it’s supposed to be and stop growing there. And I use flexbox to change their arrangements form vertical to horizontal designs. And I use responsive units to scale entire sections down to fit the screen and grow with every pixel wider it gets.

That’s the smallest possible screen size (iPhone 5s). It’s about making sure your site works on every device size. Starting at 320px is the best way to make sure you are covered no matter how small the screen is. Sometimes I have to make a separate query for 375px to 400px or whatever to start the larger mobile screens. Like at 320px I might make my main h1 a smaller font size and then at 375px or 400px I’ll make it bigger for larger phones.

I don't bother with the 5s.

The 5 series has been officially discontinued since 2017, and hasn't been sold new since just before the start of 2016.

My recommendation is making your smallest media query 360px, that covers all iPhone SE's.

Don't go off of recommendations or assumptions. Put google analytics on your site and look at the usage data. Got a lot of 5s users? You better support it. Otherwise ignore it.

But. It’s whatever you wanna do. I feel like there’s still a few older people out there with one, and maybe in the next couple years I’ll move on to 360px minimum start as those will be almost non existent.

Responsive breakpoints are very common and widely used to address this issue. I'm surprised you know of media queries but not responsive design. Like being a race car driver but wondering what an engine is.

You can use media queries to set different widths for you main content container.

These widths have become psuedo standardised. Here are tailwind CSS's responsive width sizes: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design

To answer you're question, you could simply use 100% width on your parent container and give it a max width (like 1280) so its still readable for big screens. Obviously it greatly depends on what you're doing.

If you have sidebars and or columns... You need to learn about responsive design to aid your decision making.

Oh sorry someone else mentioned media queries not you. Yeah - use "breakpoints" via media queries to set your containing div to fixed max widths, and make the inner containing divs 100% so they stretch to the parent.

You absolutely do not need media queries every step of the way. CSS functions like min, max, clamp and calc can go a long way. Media queries can sometimes be more predictable though if you want a completely different layout across screens.

Oh yes, absolutely, I agree.

I am not sure about that but I have the feeling that most developers still think in terms of "device size" instead of "layout structure". Which leads to a media query hell, obviously.

Media queries aren't hard. Read the documentation, wrap your head around them.

This post reads like you're trying to find shortcuts to avoid learning.

If you're expecting to need media queries for every specific screen size, you're probably missing some fundamental CSS knowledge around thinks like min/max width, calcs, floats, etc.

The "Easiest way to make website responsive on all screens" - is to not make it unresponsive.

All pages are responsive by default. (with a few things in place like the viewport metatag).

"How do you design and build a website that isn't broken" - is a much larger question than a Reddit thread.

Here's a video about building small screen first. Here's a CodePen about how media queries work. If you design your page-structure/layout with the small screen in mind as the main screen, then you can add a little CSS to course correct as the screen gets larger and you have more space to work within.

RE: rem If you don't know what they are, (in general) then - don't use them - until you've read about them. "rem" stands for "root em." em is a historically playful name based on the width of an M character. But It might be easier to think of it as "relative" to the user's preferences. Most browsers allow you to set the font-size to "small", "medium/normal" "large" and "extra-large." So, 1rem is usually about 16px. rem is great for body copy so that people can adjust the font size based on their preferences. However - not everything should be that unit. You can always use px - until you have time to learn a little more about accessible typography.

How about - you show us your code?

I really hope some of you genius devs reply to my comment b/c I am in a very, very emergency situation. I was given a figma design of screen sizes 1440x1024 and 390x480 respectively. As someone who is new to frontend and a startup, I started with the web version, took hell lots of code from Gemini and today is my ultimatum to get it all right and fixed on ALL SIZES. Now, what I am doing is I am creating the pixel-perfect page on the screens sizes same as Figma and scaling the rest up and down using media queries. If you feel anything I am doing is a wrong approach to fix, lmk. If there's any alternative to do this right, lmk. Much appreciated as this is kinda urgent, thanks.


Ever tapped a hamburger menu that doesn’t work or struggled with a button that’s too small? As a designer, you’ve probably felt that frustration and seen users deal with it during testing. With mobile now the main way people browse, mobile-friendly design isn’t optional—it’s the baseline.

Whether updating a site, launching a product, or refreshing your portfolio, strong mobile design is key to keeping users happy. So what makes a mobile experience great, and how do you add creative touches without missing the basics?

Read on to learn:

Key features of mobile Web design

Key features of mobile website design
Designing for mobile isn’t just about smaller screens, touch controls, or varying Internet speeds. It’s about understanding context. Mobile users are often on the move, multitasking, or seeking quick answers.

These users tend to skim rather than read deeply, so mobile design should prioritize clarity and ease of use from the start. That’s why effective mobile-friendly websites consistently include these key features:

Vertical display. Content appears in a single column to fit small screens better.
Large, well-labeled buttons. These should be easy to see and tap with fingers, helping users navigate smoothly on mobile devices. Use colors that stand out from your website’s color scheme to draw attention and improve usability.
Clean design with enough space. This makes content simple to read and helps users avoid mistakes.
Clear calls to action (CTAs) near the top. Place CTAs near the top to instantly communicate the following steps, minimizing the need for scrolling or searching.
Simplified menus. Designers often hide them behind a hamburger icon to save space.
Less text with readable font size. Keep content easy to scan by using only the most important information, and choose a font size that remains clear and legible on small screens.
These features help mobile users find what they need quickly and easily.

Why mobile Web design matters
Focusing on mobile-first design can elevate your entire digital experience. Here are a few key benefits of prioritizing mobile-first Web design:

Mobile-first indexing. Google looks at your mobile site first when it ranks you in search results. If your mobile site works well, it’s easier for people to find you online.
Better user experience and faster loading times. People want websites that load fast and are easy to use on their phones. A good mobile design makes your site quick and simple to navigate, so visitors stay longer.
Increased brand awareness and sales. People trust your brand more when your site works well on phones and tablets. It’s also easier for them to buy something or sign up, which helps your business grow.
Mobile website design best practices
Ready to design a mobile site that works everywhere? These best practices can help you create smooth user experiences and make your designs shine on any device.

Use a responsive design
A responsive design helps your website work well on any screen size. It automatically adjusts the layout and page elements to fit phones, tablets, and desktops.

With Figma Sites, you get ready-made, fully responsive templates that make designing a breeze. You don’t have to worry about tweaking aspect ratios or building different layouts for each device. Your site will look awesome everywhere, right from the start.

Design a mobile-friendly website
Launch faster with pre-built, fully responsive templates and components that look great on every device.

Get started
Incorporate touch-friendly elements with clear CTAs
Make buttons, links, and forms easy to tap by using large touch targets of at least 44x44 pixels and enough spacing to prevent accidental taps. Clear calls to action help users understand what to do next without frustration.

Avoid using pop-ups
Pop-ups can frustrate users and interrupt their flow. They often block content and interrupt the site experience. Think about other ways to share meaningful content, like banners or in-line messages.

Choose fonts that are easy to read
Writing concise and scannable content is essential for smaller screens, as is choosing an appropriate font. Use fonts optimized for websites. Clean and simple options, like Roboto, Inter, or Montserrat, are easy on the eyes and help users find information faster.

Use a “back to top” button
Pages are often longer on mobile devices, which means more scrolling. A “back to top” button lets users quickly return to the top of the page, which makes browsing smoother and more convenient.

Link the logo back to the homepage
Users expect your logo to take them back to your homepage. This is a standard shortcut (especially when the navigation menu tucks away), and provides a familiar, reliable way for users to return to the main page. Breadcrumbs also help users navigate back and reduce bounce by showing their location within the site.

Simplify navigation
Mobile users have less time and smaller screens, so you make menus clean and clear. Create a scroll-friendly layout that helps users navigate your site quickly and confidently. Keep menus short, use a hamburger icon to save space, and avoid long forms or too many buttons. Simple navigation makes it easier for people to find what they need.

Optimize load times/image sizes
Fast loading speeds are crucial on mobile. Compress images, limit animations, and remove anything that slows your page down. Use optimized formats like JPEG for photos and PNG for graphics with transparency. A faster site keeps users engaged and delivers a smoother, more enjoyable user experience.

Prioritize accessible design
Design inclusively and accessibly, always. Use things like:

Strong color contrast
Readable fonts
Labels that screen readers can process
Large touch targets
Keyboard-friendly navigation
Alt text
Accessibility benefits all users and shows that you value inclusive experiences. Plugins like Able make it easier to identify and fix accessibility issues early in your design process.

10 best mobile website design examples
Great mobile design looks good, loads quickly, and performs well on small screens. Most importantly, users find it easy to navigate. The examples below show how different brands solve common mobile design challenges. Use them as inspiration as you plan your own mobile website design.

Example 1: Trustworthy app download
A screenshot of an app download mobile website template
This mobile layout uses shades of green to create a calm, clean look. It features large buttons and text boxes that users can easily tap and read on a phone.

The design includes short, simple text and clear icons, helping users quickly locate information. Its high-contrast color palette also makes the site more accessible for all users.

Example 2: Retro-industrial music event
A screenshot of a music event mobile website template
Designers often simplify mobile designs to make content easier to scan, but that doesn’t mean they have to be boring. To create a bold look, this design uses bright, contrasting colors and the unique, readable Martian Mono font. The layout remains user-friendly, with a large “Buy Tickets” button and a clear headliner schedule that users can easily explore.

Example 3: Sweet flower shop
A screenshot of a flower shop mobile website template
This delicate template uses a hamburger menu that opens into a complete list of options. Just remember to keep the menu text short and easy to understand. A hamburger icon helps keep the page clean so the rest of the site shines.

There’s also plenty of white space, which makes the buttons and product or service sections stand out in a way that’s easy to follow.

Example 4: Sincere, professional legal services
A screenshot of a professional legal services mobile website template
Sometimes, websites need more copy to give users all the information they need. Thanks to smart use of visual hierarchy, this design includes more text but still feels clean and easy to navigate. It features clear headers and scannable body copy, and breaks up content sections with different background colors.

These techniques guide the eye, making longer blocks of text feel manageable on a small screen. A fixed top menu bar also keeps key pages within easy reach, so users can jump around without getting lost.

Example 5: Performance-driven gym
A screenshot of a gym company mobile website template
When you’re making a contact section for a mobile website, keep it simple. This example lays out the text on the left side, including contact information, store hours, and social media links.

Use a user-friendly font for contact details. If users can’t read it, they can’t reach or connect with you on social media.

Example 6: Friendly accounting services
A screenshot of an accounting services mobile website template
You can have fun with illustrations on a mobile site, but they shouldn’t get in the way on a smaller screen. This design uses cool, unique illustrations to break up the text on the page.

It also has CTA buttons with bold colors, so users can easily find the pages they want to visit. The navigation menu at the top helps users find exactly what they’re looking for without having to scroll around.

Example 7: Group event
A screenshot of a group event mobile website template
This template puts the most essential information and the main button at the top, letting users quickly access key content without scrolling. There’s also a simple menu at the top for easy navigation. Even though the design uses three different fonts, they’re all legible and match the overall look and style of the site.

Example 8: Moody dance studio
A screenshot of a dance studio mobile website template
This mobile design stands out with its bold use of high-quality, full-bleed imagery that adapts beautifully to smaller screens. While it includes more text than other templates, generous white space keeps the layout clean and easy to scan.

The colorful rectangular buttons pop against the black-and-white visuals, drawing users to key information. To maintain fast load times on mobile, optimize large images using modern formats like WebP or AVIF, which reduce file size without compromising quality.

Example 9: Modern product launch
A screenshot of a product launch mobile website template
This website uses familiar HTML elements in clever, mobile-friendly ways. A sticky navigation menu appears at the top, making it easy for users to jump between pages without scrolling. The prominent “Learn More” CTA, likely a styled button or link, encourages deeper exploration.

A standout feature is the horizontally scrollable table, often built using <div>s with overflow settings rather than traditional table elements. This approach keeps content compact and interactive on smaller screens while improving load performance and responsiveness.

Example 10: Modern-retro beverage brand
A screenshot of a beverage brand mobile website template
This template is a great example of how to keep a strong brand look while working well on phones. The design uses white space to keep things clean and easy to follow. It also shows off the products with beautiful images that work as buttons. The text is readable thanks to a bold color combination.

Mobile website design FAQ
How do I create a mobile-friendly website design?
Start with a responsive layout that adjusts to different screen sizes. Keep navigation simple and use large touch targets so it’s easy to tap. Make sure the most important content comes first, and test your design on real devices to see how it feels.

What are the main differences between mobile and desktop sites?
Mobile sites work best on small screens and use touch for navigation. Designers often use:

Simpler layouts
Larger text
Elements that load fast
This makes them easy to read and tap on the go. Desktop sites have more space to show more content and features across a larger canvas.

Are there differences between mobile URLs and desktop URLs?
Most modern websites use the same URL for both mobile and desktop. Designers call this responsive design. Some older or separate mobile sites still use different URLs, though. For example, you might see m.example.com for mobile.

Today, using one URL is more common, where the layout changes based on screen size.

What is the best size for mobile website design?
There isn’t one “best” size for mobile design. Responsive sites are helpful in this area, where the layout adjusts to fit any screen size. This works for small phones and large desktops, and you can find standard screen size guides in the Figma resource library.
